# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles settings based on the work of a lot of people:

* Vim settings: based on [yadr](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) and uses plugin written by [junegunn] (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Zsh settings: based on [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) written by [sorin ionescu](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu) and uses plugin manager [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) which is written and maintained by [b4b4r07](https://github.com/b4b4r07).
